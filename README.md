Overview of resources about gaming on linux

## Distro
Recommended distro for gaming on Linux:
- Manjaro
- https://manjaro.org/download/Manjaro
- Why Manjaro: It's bleeding edge and based on Arch Linux, but simpler to set up than Arch. Other distros like Pop-OS are usually based on Ubuntu and often do not have the latest software available. Since gaming on Linux is a rapidly changing environment, using a bleeding edge distro is an advantage.
