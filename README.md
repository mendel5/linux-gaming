## Distro
Note: This part about the recommended distro for gaming on Linux was written some time ago. It might not be up to date anymore. Please do your own research.

Recommended distro for gaming on Linux:
- Manjaro
- Download Manjaro: https://manjaro.org/download/Manjaro
- Why Manjaro: It's bleeding edge and based on Arch Linux, but simpler to set up than Arch. Other distros like Pop-OS are usually based on Ubuntu and often do not have the latest software available. Since gaming on Linux is a rapidly changing environment, using a bleeding edge distro is an advantage.
